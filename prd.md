Product Requirements Document (PRD): xCommerce - A Django/Python E-Commerce Platform
1. Document Overview
1.1 Purpose
This PRD outlines the requirements for xCommerce, an open-source, highly customizable e-commerce platform built using Django (Python web framework). Designed to rival and surpass Shopify in functionality, ease of use, and extensibility, xCommerce will enable users to quickly set up, manage, and scale online stores. It emphasizes portability (running on any environment via Docker), rebrandability (white-labeling for custom branding), and robustness (enterprise-grade security, scalability, and reliability).
xCommerce will be "Shopify-like" in its core user experience but superior through innovative features like AI-driven personalization, seamless multi-channel integration, and eco-friendly tools. Core features will be free/open-source, with premium add-ons (e.g., advanced shipping automation) available via a subscription model or one-time purchases.
1.2 Version History

Version 1.0: Initial draft (September 2025)
Stakeholders: Product Manager (hypothetical), Development Team (Django/Python experts), Users (merchants, developers)

1.3 Scope

In Scope: Core e-commerce functionalities, admin dashboard, customer storefront, integrations, premium shipping features.
Out of Scope: Physical hardware integration (e.g., POS systems beyond API support), custom mobile app development (focus on web/PWA).

4. Features and Requirements
xCommerce will be modular, with a core engine and pluggable apps (Django apps). Features are divided into Core (free) and Premium (paid add-ons).
4.1 Core Features
These mirror Shopify's essentials but with enhancements for better usability and performance.

4.1.4 Analytics and Reporting

Built-in Dashboards: Sales trends, customer insights, traffic sources. Use Matplotlib/Plotly for visualizations.
Enhancement: Predictive analytics (forecast sales using Prophet library), A/B testing for pages/products.

4.1.5 Marketing and SEO Tools

Email/SMS Marketing: Integrated with SendGrid/Twilio. Automation workflows (e.g., welcome series).
SEO Optimization: Meta tags, sitemaps, schema markup. Better than Shopify: AI content optimizer for product pages.
